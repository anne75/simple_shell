.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell
is the standard command interpreter for the system.
The current version of
.B shell
is a simple shell.
.SS Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system.
The shell implements a language that has flow control
constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in
addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing
capabilities.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and
has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both
interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands
can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and
the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.SS Invocation
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell
is connected to a terminal (or if the
.FL i
flag is set),
and the
.FL c
option is not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles
programming and command errors differently (as described below).
When first starting,
the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a dash
.SQ - ,
the shell is also considered
a login shell.
This is normally done automatically by the system
when the user first logs in.
A login shell first reads commands
from the files
.PA /etc/profile
and
.PA .profile
if they exist.
If the environment variable
.EV ENV
is set on entry to an interactive shell, or is set in the
.PA .profile
of a login shell, the shell next reads
commands from the file named in
.EV ENV .
Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed only at
login time in the
.PA .profile
file, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside the
.EV ENV
file.
To set the
.EV ENV
variable to some file, place the following line in your
.PA .profile
of your home directory
.PP
.Dl ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV
.PP
substituting for
.DQ .shinit
any filename you wish.
.PP
If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then
the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file from which to
read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the
positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).
Otherwise, the shell
reads commands from its standard input.
.SS Argument List Processing
All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be
used as an argument to the
.FL o
option.
The set
.FL o
name is provided next to the single letter option in
the description below.
Specifying a dash
.Dq -
turns the option on, while using a plus
.DQ +
disables the option.
The following options can be set from the command line or
with the
.IC set
builtin (described later).
.BL -tag -width aaaallexportfoo -offset indent
.IT Fl a Em allexport
Export all variables assigned to.
.IT Fl c
Read commands from the
.AR command_string
operand instead of from the standard input.
Special parameter 0 will be set from the
.AR command_name
operand and the positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)
set from the remaining argument operands.
.IT Fl C Em noclobber
Don't overwrite existing files with
.DQ \*[Gt] .
.IT Fl e Em errexit
.\"cut here
.IT Ev PPID
The process ID of the parent process of the shell.
